General Market Framework
=================================

Our goal for GMF is to create generalised market designed to be the backbone to "sharing economy" services, our examples will include a Car Ride service & a Fiat/Cryptocurrency exchange service.

Traders add tickets to the pool with their preferences(price, dispute contract address, trade contract address, etc), covering their ticket price with insurance references(from [TrustDavis](https://github.com/syng-io/trustdavis)), 

Match Makers are used to pair the Traders, adding sealed offers that match, when revealed (or after sealed bid TBD) the Traders have the option accept or decline the match, only when both accepted will a trade contract be created.
