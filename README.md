GMF is generalised market designed to be the backbone to "sharing economy" services, our examples will include a Car Ride service & a Fiat/Cryptocurrency exchange service.


Traders add tickets to the pool with their preferences(price, dispute contract address, trade contract address, etc) and a bounty, covering their ticket price with insurance references(from trustdavis), match makers add sealed offers that match traders, when revealed the buyer & seller have the option accept or decline, only when both accepted will a trade contract be created.
